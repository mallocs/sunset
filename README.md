# Sunset theme

Sunset is designed to have a large cover photo that can be cropped down to the
lower-left corner. In this way, different screen sizes are supported through
cropping the image rather than resizing it, within limits.

If no logo is defined, the blog title will act like the logo and will disappear
from the places would have appeared in Casper.
